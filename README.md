# QuestHands
An Unreal Engine 4 plugin for extending the official Oculus Quest Hands Tracking integration.

This plugins original purpose was to intergrate the Oculus Hands Tracking for Unreal Engine 4 in general when Oculus first released the API back in December. 
Now that the official integration has been released, the plugin is being re-purposed to extend the official plugin and add extra functionality.

This plugin version requires version 17 of the Oculus Plugin so you need to use the Oculus branch of the Unreal Engine for this plugin to work.

The Oculus branch can be found here: https://github.com/Oculus-VR/UnrealEngine/tree/oculus-4.25.0-release-1.49.0-v17.0

Other versions of this plugin designed for integrating hands tracking into SDK versions less than 17 can be found as branches of this repo.
