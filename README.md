# QuestHands
An Unreal Engine 4 plugin for the new Oculus Quest hands tracking. To tied us over till Oculus's official release.

This plugin requires version 12 of the Oculus Plugin so you need to use the Oculus branch of the Unreal Engine for this plugin to work. This means the plugin expects at least Unreal Engine 4.24.1 to compile / work reliably.

The Oculus branch can be found here: https://github.com/Oculus-VR/UnrealEngine/tree/oculus-4.24.1-release-1.44.0-v12.0
